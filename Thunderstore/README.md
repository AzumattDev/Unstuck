# Description

## Unstuck

Press a key to get unstuck, which defaults to only when underwater. Change all values in the config file.

Radius is the distance from the player to check for a valid position to teleport to. Max radius is the maximum radius to
check for a valid position. Increment Step is the distance to increase the radius by if a valid position is not found.

The config file is generated after booting the game with the mod once. You can find it
in `BepInEx/config/Azumatt.Unstuck.cfg`
I do recommend using
the [ConfigurationManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/sunkenland/p/Azumatt/BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/) to change this
key bind and other values live while you're in-game.
